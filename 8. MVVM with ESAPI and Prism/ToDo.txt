	MVVM with Prism and ESAPI


	- Why MVVM is so difficult...
		- need a lot of extra code to monitor and update changes in a view
		- all the views are separated....these hard to connect and update
		- button events are difficult now that we're not using the "code behind"

	- Prism can help...
		- the BindableBase class helps with monitoring changes and updating the view
		- DelegateCommands help by making button events much more straight forward
		- PubSubEvents make updating different views much simpler
